# Hateful Memes Detection

Take an image, add some text: you've got a meme. Internet memes are often harmless and sometimes hilarious. However, by using certain types of images, text, or combinations of each of these data modalities, the seemingly non-hateful meme becomes a multimodal type of hate speech, a hateful meme.

[Starter code](https://github.com/facebookresearch/mmf/tree/master/projects/hateful_memes) from Facebook AI's MMF is also available on GitHub to help you get started.


## Facebook AI
The goal is to create an algorithm that identifies multimodal hate speech in internet memes.
